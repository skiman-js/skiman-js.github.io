          <h3>I have a passion around seeing people succeed.</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>I am a Scrum Master leading, teaching, coaching, and mentoring two software development teams in their agile transition at Comcast Advanced Business Class services in Lakewood Colorado. </p>
          <p> With over 20 years of experience in technology, I apply a common-sense, iterative approach to building software and help teams make continuous improvements in their daily work.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> I believe in transparency, a commitment to the agile values, collaboration, starting meetings on time and ending them early, and having fun. </p>
          <p> I'm always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it. <br>
